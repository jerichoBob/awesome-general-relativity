This breaks with the "awesome-" format, but I wanted a place to put my own jupyter notebook experiments (using vpython / glowscript).

This also breaks from the really easy way to get started with vpython, which is to go to vpython.org or glowscript.org and click "Get Started" -- that will give you a browser-based IDE with no installation necessary. The downside to this methodology is that if you need to install other python libraries, you'll need to install vpython on your own machine so you can fully control the environment.

## Installation

https://vpython.org/
https://vpython.org/presentation2018/install.html
https://pypi.org/project/vpython/

## Getting Started

To run, open up a terminal window and type:
    % jupyter notebook
